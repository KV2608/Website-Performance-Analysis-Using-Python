# Website-Performance-Analysis-Using-Python

**Project Overview:**

This project delves into a detailed analysis of website performance metrics using Python to evaluate the effectiveness of different marketing channels, user engagement, and overall website traffic. Utilizing a rich dataset from the platform 'statso', the project identifies trends, patterns, and correlations among various performance metrics such as user sessions, engagement rates, and events per session. The analysis leverages statistical and machine learning techniques to predict future traffic patterns and provide actionable insights.

**Data Description:**

The dataset contains multiple columns such as Session primary channel group, Date + hour, Users, Sessions, Engaged sessions, Average engagement time per session, and others that track user interaction and engagement metrics over time.

**Analytical Approach:**

**Session Analysis:**

Visualization of user and session data to identify daily cycles or high-traffic periods.

Analysis of session trends to determine the impact of marketing activities or events.

**User Engagement Analysis:**

Exploration of key metrics like average engagement time, engagement rate, and events per session using detailed graphical analysis.

Use of scatter plots to illustrate the relationship between various engagement metrics, highlighting how user behavior correlates with content interaction.

**Channel Performance Analysis:**

Segmenting data by marketing channels to assess how each contributes to overall traffic and user engagement

Comparative analysis to determine the effectiveness of channels such as Organic Search, Referral, and Organic Video in engaging users.

**Forecasting Website Traffic:**

Application of time series analysis techniques, including autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots, to determine the parameters for a SARIMA model.

Prediction of future website traffic for the next 24 hours using the identified model, providing insights into potential traffic trends and allowing for proactive strategy adjustments.

**Tools and Technologies:**

Python: Used for data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.

Libraries: Pandas for data processing, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Statsmodels for time series forecasting.

Jupyter Notebook: Served as the platform for conducting analyses, documenting the process, and visualizing the results.

**Results and Insights :**

Identified key drivers of user engagement and effective marketing channels.

Demonstrated the potential of predictive analytics in forecasting website performance, aiding in strategic planning and optimization.

Provided actionable recommendations based on data-driven insights to enhance website engagement and efficiency.


**This project not only enhances understanding of website dynamics and user behavior but also showcases the application of advanced data science techniques in real-world scenarios. Through meticulous analysis and predictive modeling, the project contributes significantly to strategic decision-making and digital marketing optimization.**
